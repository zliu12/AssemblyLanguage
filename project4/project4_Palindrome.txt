TITLE Add and Subtract, Version 2         (AddSub2.asm)
; Project 4 - Palindrom
; Zhao Liu
; This program has an array of 15 bytes initialized to the characters "NeverOddOrEven".
; When executing, the program swaps the first and last characters, then the second and next to last
; and so on creating the palindrome of the original array.
